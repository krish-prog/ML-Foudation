## 🔍 What This Repository Covers

### 🧠 Core Concepts
- NumPy fundamentals (arrays, broadcasting, masking, centering, standardization)
- Data preprocessing and feature scaling
- Understanding `fit`, `transform`, and `fit_transform`
- Handling real-world data shapes (samples × features)

### 📊 Machine Learning
- Data preparation pipelines
- Feature engineering basics
- Model-ready preprocessing using **scikit-learn**
- Proper train/test data handling (avoiding data leakage)

### 🤖 Deep Learning (Learning & Practice Stage)
