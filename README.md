- NumPy arrays and axis understanding
- Column-wise mean computation
- Data centering using NumPy
- Masking and column selection
- Standardization using sklearn StandardScaler
- Understanding fit(), transform(), fit_transform()
- Broadcasting concept

## Goal
Build strong fundamentals before moving into full Machine Learning and Deep Learning models.

## Tools
- Python
- NumPy
- scikit-learn

## Status
Learning in progress 🚀
